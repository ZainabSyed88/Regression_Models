# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning  

This repository contains a **Machine Learning project** aimed at predicting house prices based on various features using regression algorithms.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **House_price_Prediction (1).ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook implementing the house price prediction model.  
- **Regression_Algorithms.ipynb** - A notebook explaining different regression algorithms, possibly used for comparison.  
- **USA_Housing.csv** - A dataset containing house price data (features and target variable).  
- **train.csv** - Training dataset for model development.  
- **test.csv** - Testing dataset for evaluating model performance.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to develop a **predictive model** that estimates house prices based on given features. This involves:  
- **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualizing key trends in the data.  
- **Model Training** - Implementing regression algorithms to predict prices.  
- **Evaluation** - Measuring performance using metrics like RMSE, R², etc.
